Plan: User inputs a game and program outputs 3 similar games to recommend.

Similarity criteria:
    1. Genre (RPG, FPS, etc.) -> limit of 3
    2. Subject (Fantasy, war, etc.) - user-defined tags
    3. Popularity
    4. Rating

Steps:
    1. Scrape game data from steam
        - Clean data
        - Generate an array of criteria for each game -> or put into CSV?
    2. Similarity algorithm -> Apriori
        - Create node for each game
        - Calculate similarity score between each two nodes
        - If similarity score is above a certain threshold, add weighted edge between the two nodes
    3. Search algorithm
        - Given user input game, find that node in the database and return 3 closest nodes
        - If game doesn't exist, scrape for game title???? create node and edges while returning 3 highest scoring nodes
    4. Visualization for demo
